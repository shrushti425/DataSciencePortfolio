# Codes 🔥
75 Days of Coding, One Tweet at a Time 🧑‍💻

Welcome to the "Codes" folder, where I’ve been documenting my coding journey—one tweet at a time—on X (formerly Twitter). For the past 75 days, I’ve challenged myself to code every day and share my progress. 

## What's Inside? 🗂️
- **Daily Code Challenges**: Each day, I tackle a new coding problem or build a small project, pushing myself to learn and improve.
- **X (Twitter) Updates**: A chronological collection of my daily coding tweets and insights—because coding isn’t just about writing lines of code; it’s about sharing progress and learning together.
- **Milestones**: Celebrating key moments in my coding journey, from solving tough problems to completing significant projects.

## Why Should You Care? 🤔
If you’re looking for a glimpse into my coding evolution or want to join me on this 75-day journey, this is where the magic happens. Whether you’re here for inspiration, tips, or just to see how I handle the ups and downs of coding, this folder is for you.

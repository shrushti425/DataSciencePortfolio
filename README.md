# Shrushti's Data Science Universe 🌌  
Welcome, Data Science Dreamers, Curious Coders, and Wandering Enthusiasts! 📊  
Step into my repository, where data takes shape, algorithms dance, and models occasionally behave the way they’re supposed to—well, mostly. This is my little corner of GitHub, where I’m piecing together the puzzles of machine learning, AI, and analytics to (hopefully) become a Data Science powerhouse. 🚀
